Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:
No, it will cause to Constructor Overloading with the same parameters lists and Ambiguity with the same String data type input.
To avoid this problem, we should use different number of parameters and different data types.
